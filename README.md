# Source code for WQR-ADMM and parallel WQR-ADMM algorithms 

It can be used to reproduce the simulation studies in the following paper:

**Ye Fan, Nan Lin and Liqun Yu**. *Distributed Quantile Regression for Longitudinal Big Data.*

Two main functions are included: **WQRADMM( )** and **paraWQRADMM( )**, repectively designed for non-distributed and distributed environments.
